# Neptune3Plus
This is what I consider to be the perfect Klipper configuration for my Elegoo Neptune 3 Plus running Klipper with a BigTreeTech Pad7 and its included ADXL345 Acceleromiter.

My ADXL isn't perminantly fitted to the printer at the moment so is commented out and simply uncommented when the ADXL345 is fixed to the printer.

Using this configuration I was able to safely hit Accelerations of 12,000 before losing steps on the Y Axis.
